# image-editor
Edit and create images by directly manipulating raw pixel data.

This is a C++ program that reads pixel data into a vector of RGB values (0-255). Operations can then be performed on the data to appy various effects to the image, which can then be saved as a new image.

### Currently only supports 24-bit bitmap images.
